> **A transparent, artist-first platform for tokenizing artwork and establishing verifiable ownership on the blockchain.**

The Tokenized Art Project is a comprehensive Web3 platform that empowers artists to mint, sell, and preserve their artwork as NFTs while maintaining complete ownership rights and earning perpetual royalties.

- 👨‍🎨 **Artist Royalties** - EIP-2981 royalty standard with automatic distribution
- 🏛️ **Decentralized Marketplace** - Buy and sell artworks with transparent pricing
- 📜 **Provenance Tracking** - Complete ownership history on-chain
- 💾 **Permanent Preservation** - IPFS/Arweave integration for artwork storage
- 🌐 **Modern Web Interface** - Next.js 14 with Web3 wallet integration
